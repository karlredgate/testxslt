todo testxslt

- courier font in result tab / text
- pdf view window vert. scrollbar start at top
- if result was saved, use that dir or that path as base url for the WebKit call


- line numbers

- Alt-ESC: completion and position cursor after inserted end tag

- svg rendering (batik, librsvg?)


- scan for all tags, build context menu.
  - wrap if selection
  - insert empty pair otherwise, cursor in between
  - analyze frequence for ranking in context menu.
  
  
- syntax coloring at least for xsl tags

-----------------
- CVS tags everywhere

I found a bug in TestXSLT. I work with Spanish and French texts. I am doing my Phd. Thesis at the University of Geneva using XML for Natural Language Processing. I found your program, which works very well. I am happy with it. Nevertheless, I had a little problem, and I found the cause. In my computer I have the names of the directories in French and Spanish. As you know, in both languages we have diacritics for some words (êtes, España, etc.); so, some of my directories have accented words. When I read a XML and a XSLT files to be processed, theres is no problem. But, if I have an import rule (<xsl:import href"..." />) and in the directory tree exists one, or more, subdirectories with accents (ê, á, é, ê, etc.), I get this:
 
     Error on line 4 of your XSLT code:
     cannot open file ”/Users/myname/Documents/Somedirectory/Accentedcharacter/name.xsl”
 
 Is there a way to avoid this?
 
 I hope this information will be useful for future versions.
 
 Best regards,

don't abort on xsl:message (for sure in libxslt, check in sablotron).
output message in error drawer, but don't abort

-----------------


Processing time...
-> more precision

-----------------

Another thing: can you add a shell command performed by the app that calls FOP and build pdf or the other supplied formats?

------------------



What I'd like to be able to do, is select my .xml and my .xsl files in the Finder and drag them onto your TestXSLT application icon, have it read both files, putting the contained data into the appropriate tab areas. Make sense?

-----------------

I like drag-and-drop, but it'd be nice if I could drag both the xsl and xml files and drop them together on the app, and for it to be smart enough to place them in the proper panes.

Second, if you you could offer tag-completion a la Oxygen (based on the dtd, or at least for it to learn based on the structure of the xml file you give it, with options placed in a contextual menu item or otherwise easily vewiable and accessible), that would be GREAT!
